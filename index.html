             <p> I fell in love with technology when I got my first job at age of 15.  I used to work in a big company in my home country, Brazil.
                 There I learned how to fix computers, how to build websites and learn how to deal with problems and people. So, since my first day at that job,
                 I learned that I had two passions in my career life: Computers and health care. At age of 17 I had to decided what major should I choose, and I chose health care. I worked as Physical Therapy for 10 years. But I was missing something in my life. So now I decided that is the time to persuade my other passion and dream: To become a web developer. </p>
             <p>I recently wrapped up a full stack flex program in Web Development which will give me all the experience that I need to become a web
                developer. I’m very excited to be back on technology field and I’m looking forward for an opportunity. </p>
             <p>I’m very friendly, passionate for the things that I love, hard working and aptitude to learn quickly. I love help people and animals.
                I am making a full transition to web development and would appreciate any advice you might have to share.</p>
